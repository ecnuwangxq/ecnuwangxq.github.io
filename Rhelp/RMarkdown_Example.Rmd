# 一级标题

## 二级标题

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(gapminder)

# 在R代码中添加注释
head(gapminder)
```

## Including Plots

You can embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including Tables

You can embed tables, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "China") %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

Note that the `results = 'asis'` parameter was added to the code chunk to output the table as formatted.
